# ICIE Windows guide

## How to install Clang (the C++ compiler)?

1. Go to the [official LLVM downloads page](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html).
2. Find the "Pre-Built Binaries" section.
3. Find the "Windows (64-bit)" link, and download it.
4. Install the LLVM from the downloaded executable.
    - Make sure to select the "Add to PATH" option. If you do not do this, ICIE will not notice that Clang is installed.
5. After the installation is finished, restart Visual Studio Code.
